## OpenH264 Rust API

Idiomatic and low-level bindings for [OpenH264](https://github.com/cisco/openh264), converting between these two in Rust:

### Example API

**Decode** some H.264 bitstream to YUV:

```rust,ignore
use openh264::decoder::Decoder;
use openh264::nal_units;

let h264_in = include_bytes!("../tests/data/multi_512x512.h264");
let mut decoder = Decoder::new()?;

// Split H.264 into NAL units and decode each.
for packet in nal_units(h264_in) {
    // On the first few frames this may fail, so you should check the result
    // a few packets before giving up.
    let maybe_some_yuv = decoder.decode(packet);
}
```

And **encode** the same YUV back to H.264:

```rust,ignore
use openh264::encoder::Encoder;

let mut encoder = Encoder::new()?;

// Encode YUV back into H.264.
let bitstream = encoder.encode(&yuv)?;
```

### Platform Support

### Compile Features

- `source` - Uses the bundled OpenH264 source; works out of the box (default).
- `libloading` - You'll need to provide Cisco's prebuilt library.

### FAQ

- **How does `openh264-sys2` differ from `openh264-sys`?**

  We directly ship OpenH264 source code and provide simple, hand-crafted compilation via `cc` in `build.rs`. Our `openh264-sys2` crate should compile via `cargo build` out of the box on most platforms, and cross-compile via `cargo build --target ...` as long as the environment variable `CXX` is properly set.

- **Which exact OpenH264 version does this use?**

  See [this file](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/openh264-rust/tree/master/openh264-sys2/upstream/VERSION) for the upstream URL and Git hash used on latest master.

- **I need to fix an important OpenH264 security hole, how can I update the library?**

  Cisco's OpenH264 library is contained in `openh264-sys2/upstream`. Updating is as simple as [pulling their latest source](https://github.com/cisco/openh264), and running `update_openh264.sh` (and, if APIs changed, `regen-bindings.bat`).


- **I heard Rust is super-safe, will this make decoding my videos safe too?**

  No. Below a thin Rust layer we rely on a _very complex_ C library, and an equally complex standard. Apart from Rust being a much nicer language to work with, depending on this project will give you _no_ additional safety guarantees as far as video handling is concerned. FYI, this is _not_ making a statement about OpenH264, but about the realities of securing +50k lines of C against attacks.


- **Feature X is missing or broken, will you fix it?**

  Right now I only have time to implement what I need. However, I will gladly accept PRs either extending the APIs, or fixing bugs; see below.


- **Can I get a performance boost?**

    - Make sure you have the command `nasm` somewhere in your PATH for your current platform (should be a single, standalone executable you don't even need to install). If found by `build.rs` it should be used automatically for an up to 3x speed boost for encoding / decoding.
    - Also compile your project with `target-cpu=native` for a 3x speed boost for YUV-to-RGB conversion (e.g., check our `.cargo/config.toml` how you can easily do that for your project. Note this only works if you are an application, not a library wrapping us).


- **Decoder::decode() returned an error, is this a bug?**

  Maybe. Probably not. Some encoders can write data OpenH264 doesn't understand, and if _all_ frames fail this could either be your encoder doing exotic things, OpenH264 not having implemented a certain feature, or us having a bug.

  If only _some_ frames fail the most likely reasons are your encoder injecting _some_ special packets or transmission errors. In other words, unless you have a controlled setup you should not terminate on the first error(s), but simply continue decoding and hope for the decoder to recover.

  FWIW, we consider OpenH264's `h264dec` the reference decoder. If you can get it to emit YUV it would be a bug if we can't. However, any stream / frame it fails on is pretty much a _wontfix_ for us.


- **What's the deal with the `source` and `libloading` features?**

  See [this issue](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/openh264-rs/issues/43).

### Contributing

PRs are very welcome. Feel free to submit PRs and fixes right away. You can open issues if you want to discuss things, but due to time restrictions on my side the project will have to rely on people contributing.

Especially needed:

- [ ] BT.601 / BT.709 YUV <-> RGB Conversion
- [ ] User-pluggable and color conversions
- [ ] WASM investigation (either patch, or evidence it can't be fixed)
- [ ] Feedback which platforms successfully built on

Big shout-out to all the [contributors](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/openh264-rs/graphs/contributors) who have filed PRs so far.

Special thanks to:

- Jannik Schleicher for 3x faster YUV-to-RGB conversion.
- Charlie Zheng for 14x faster RGB-to-YUV conversion.
